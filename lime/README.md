# Lime Examples

## Prerequisites

Note that for Lime Futures related examples you will need to use Lime 8.2.0-Dev branch versions of Lime.
8.2.0 seriously updated the Futures and ThreadPool support making it quite usable for task scheduler.
https://github.com/openfl/lime/tree/develop?tab=readme-ov-file describes how to get development nightly build
versions of Lime. Refer to the Development Builds section. While this link will age https://github.com/openfl/lime/actions/runs/7848199962 has lime-haxelib.zip that works.
